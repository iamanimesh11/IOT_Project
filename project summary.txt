For this project we have two system, business logic,and backend server logic.
so what we are trying to do is simulate a real time etl of iot data .

So both system are simulated , now what happen and let's understand how data flows basically ,
So iot device like refrigerator,ac ,tv and so on generates data  like sensors data more basically as we know how iot works . 
so suppose a event like motor failure occurs and so it send to backend server .now backend server receive it .
by the time understand how business logic is working First:
a service  regsiter to backend server and it suscribe to backend sever for each device id to receive the real time events of that event 
.examplew:
service A register at backend server for device id ref_model_12 of device type refrigerator and device model "model1"
now backend server make sure every event being recieved by device alloted deivce id will send event data to that service.
now for now that is basically a event simulation .

Now how tech stack works here ? how i have configured it ?
 so backend server contrains following componenets
 1.Service registration fast api:so whenever a route is caled by post method ,backend receive it and store service detail like
   name,key,callback url,timestamp.also api return important data like service key,id which is generated by pythons function.
2. device data generator: generate mock device data based on n where n is number of devices and put them on fast api .
device data is like: device_id,device_type,model_name,reportable BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
3.customer data generator:so once mock device data is generated ,a mock customer data is generated as well referncing each device id
