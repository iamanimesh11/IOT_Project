Based on your complete project setup ‚Äî a **real-time IoT event simulation and processing system** ‚Äî you can use **Apache Airflow** to handle **orchestrated tasks**, **monitoring**, and **data processing workflows** that are not part of the real-time stream itself but are crucial for support, analytics, and system health.

Here‚Äôs exactly **how and where Airflow can fit into your project**:

## üîÅ How Airflow Can Be Used in Your IoT ETL Project

### ‚úÖ 1. **Data Aggregation & ETL Pipelines**

Airflow can be used to:

* Periodically **aggregate and summarize telemetry data** from Kafka topics or the final database.
* Run scheduled ETL pipelines to:

  * Cleanse the data
  * Transform telemetry and error logs
  * Store them into a **historical data warehouse** (like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, etc.)

Example DAG:

```python
- Extract hourly data from PostgreSQL
- Clean/Transform to highlight error frequency per device
- Load it into a reporting table for BI tools
```

---

### üìä 2. **Generate Daily or Weekly Reports**

* Airflow can generate reports like:

  * **Device health trends**
  * **Most error-prone models**
  * **Inactive devices**
* These reports can be sent via email or posted to dashboards (like Grafana or a custom web UI).

---

### üîê 3. **Subscription Expiry Checker**

You mentioned subscriptions tied to devices. Use Airflow to:

* Check every day/hour which service-device subscriptions are about to **expire**
* Send notifications or **auto-remove expired subscriptions** from Redis and PostgreSQL

---

### üìà 4. **Push Processed Data to Grafana**

* Airflow can run a DAG that exports **daily metrics** to a **time-series database (like InfluxDB or Prometheus)**, which Grafana then uses to display live charts.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. **Infrastructure Health Checks**

* Create a DAG that:

  * Pings your **MQTT broker**, **Kafka cluster**, and **FastAPI endpoints**
  * Logs and alerts if any service is down or slow
  * Sends notification to Slack/Discord if failure is detected

---

### üîÑ 6. **Device Profile Updater**

* If your `device_profile.json` (status and error types) is updated manually or from an external source, use Airflow to:

  * **Fetch the latest file**
  * Validate JSON schema
  * Push to Redis or file storage
  * Notify teams if new device types or error codes are added

---

### üí° 7. **Backfill or Replay Events (Simulation)**

* If you need to **re-simulate past device events** for testing or analytics, Airflow can trigger a script to:

  * Fetch old telemetry records
  * Push them back into MQTT or Kafka for reprocessing
